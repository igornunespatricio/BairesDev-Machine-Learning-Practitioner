# Holds the Projects from the course BairesDev - Machine Learning Practitioner
1) Transfer Learning using VGG 16 for classification of cat and dog images - [transfer_learning.ipynb](https://github.com/igornunespatricio/BairesDev-Machine-Learning-Practitioner/blob/main/transfer_learning.ipynb)
2) Dimensionality reduction: colored images to grayscale and binarization - [dimensionality_reduction.ipynb](https://github.com/igornunespatricio/BairesDev-Machine-Learning-Practitioner/blob/main/dimensionality_reduction.ipynb)
3) Small convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of handwritten digits (MNIST database) with confusion matrix and classification metrics - [Confusion_Matrix.ipynb](https://github.com/igornunespatricio/BairesDev-Machine-Learning-Practitioner/blob/main/Confusion_Matrix.ipynb)
4) Training YOLO: uses a subset of COCO dataset to train YOLO - [YOLO_training.ipynb](https://github.com/igornunespatricio/BairesDev-Machine-Learning-Practitioner/blob/main/YOLO_training.ipynb)
5) Face Recognition: Uses MTCNN for face detection and InceptionResnetV1 for face embeddings. Uses DBSCAN to group face images based on embeddings and then compare those embeddings with faces detected in unseen images - [face_recognition.ipynb](https://github.com/igornunespatricio/BairesDev-Machine-Learning-Practitioner/blob/main/face_recognition.ipynb)
6) Recommendation System: Product Recommendation Model that uses transfer learning with the [Big Transfer (BiT) ResNet-50x1](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/bit/TensorFlow2/m-r50x1/1) to extract 128-dimensional image embeddings from the [Caltech 256 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/caltech256), addressing class imbalance with class weights. It employs AnnoyIndex for efficient nearest-neighbor search, enabling fast and scalable image-based product recommendations.
