1) Transfer Learning using VGG 16 for classification of cat and dog images.
2) Dimensionality reduction: colored images to grayscale and binarization
3) Small convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of handwritten digits (MNIST database) with confusion matrix and classification metrics.
